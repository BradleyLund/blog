<h2>Big O notation</h2>

<p>
    Big o notation is a mathematical way to describe how any function grows depending on the input it receives.
    This information is very important to a web developer. It is very important if you want to understand how to build
    and work on scalable web applications. It is easy to run small web apps that only a couple of people use. In this
    case Big O notation is not too important as when n is so small it's more important to have a web app that is up and
    running and being used than to have it be optimized. The difference between an optimized and unoptimized algorithm
    at this small level will be miliseconds, almost unnoticeable to a user. The issue comes in when your web app becomes
    popular or you work at a large company with lots of data. Then the difference between using a O(n) algorithm and an
    O(2^n) algorithm is huge and could have dire consequences.

    An example of an O(n^2) function:
    <pre>
    <code>
        // loop through the matrix and work out how many mines each cell is touching
  for (let i = 0; i &#x3C; gameArray.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j &#x3C; gameArray[i].length; j++) {
      if (gameArray[i][j] !== 9) {
        let count = 0;

        // looping through the surrounding squares, checking undefined neighbours if it is an edge square
        for (let k = -1; k &#x3C; 2; k++) {
          if (gameArray[i + k] !== undefined) {
            for (let l = -1; l &#x3C; 2; l++) {
              if (gameArray[i + k][j + l] !== undefined) {
                // console.log(game[i + k][0 + l])
                if (gameArray[i + k][j + l] === 9) {
                  count++;
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
        // push the neighbouring bombCOunt to the gameArray in its position
        gameArray[i][j] = count;
      }
    }
  }
    </code>
</pre>
