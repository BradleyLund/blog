<h2>Interfaces in object oriented programminglanguages and prototype-based languages</h2>

<p>
    An interface is a description of all functions that an object must have in order to be a certain object. The purpose
    of an interface is to let the computer know that an object of a certain type will always have a set of methods that
    come with it.
</p>

<p>
    Javascript is not an OOP language it is an object based language. So objects are not created using classes but they
    are all built using prototypes. With ES2015 Javascript allows the use of the class keyword but under the hood it is
    basically a constructor function.

    In the example below we can see how ES2015 implements the class keyword. This is how you could create an object. As
    you can see each object would have a constructor function. Under the hood however it is using prototypes. If no
    constructor method is explicitly called for the class then a default constructor will be supplied.
    <pre>
        <code>
            class Person {

                constructor(name) {
                  this.name = name;
                }
              
                introduce() {
                  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
                }
              
              }
              
              const otto = new Person('Otto');
              
              otto.introduce();
              
        </code>
    </pre>

</p>

    You can emulate interfaces in Javascript. You can use comments to mimick the style of other interfacing languages,
    this isn't very effective however and is basically just documenting the intended functionality of an interface. Two
    other options that can be used in javascript to implement interfaces are attribute checking and duck typing. Duck
    typing is a quacky name which basically is born from the saying: "if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck
    then its probably a duck ðŸ¦† " Duck typing basically just checks what methods an object has and implements and if
    that is inline with a certain class then the object is of a certain class.
</p>

<p>
    Strict mode is basically an instruction sent to the browser executing a set of code that that specific code should
    be executed in strict mode. Strict mode is useful because it makes it easier to write more secure JavaScript. Strict
    mode does things like force the programmer to declare all variables. In normal javascript you can accidentally
    create a new variable by just mistyping something. Javascript will then result in a silent error but when that
    happens and strict mode is stipulated, an error will be thrown making it much easier to pick up the erro.
</p>

<p>
    Typescript is a typed superset of Javascript that is developed by Microsoft. Typescript makes javascript into a
    statically typed language where variables need to be given a data type on declaration. Typescript is clever and you
    might not need to explicitly declare the datatype. It can pick it up on variable declaration like below:
    <pre>
        <code>
            const user = {
                name: "Hayes",
                id: 0,
              };
        </code>
    </pre>

    Or you can explicitly declare the datatypes by using an interface like in the example below:
    <pre>
        <code>
            interface User {
                name: string;
                id: number;
              }
        </code>
    </pre>

    A browser cannot run TypeScript so the typescript code that is written is compiled into javascript before being
    executed.
</p>

<p>
    Typescript basically uses duck typing, explained above, to build and check interfaces.
