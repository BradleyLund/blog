title:  "FreeCodeCamp Datastructures and algorithms certification"

<h2>FCC datastructures and algorithms</h2>

<p>
one of the first things I did once I had started learning javascript through freecodecamp is start the Javascript datastructures and algorithms 
certification. It is something I really enjoy, much like the challenges on codewars. It's probably my favorite part of the freecodecamp syllabus.
It gives me the same awesome feelings that high school maths gave me. Kind of going through the same process: 
<ul>
    <li>reading the problem 📖 </li>
    <li>thinking it won't be too difficult to solve. 🤸‍♀️ </li>
    <li>struggling through it 🤓 </li>
    <li>getting that dopamine when it passes all the tests 🙋 </li>
</ul>

It was very fun doing these projects. Here you can find the link to the problems and my solutions:
